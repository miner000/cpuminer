This fork, by miner000, is just an attempt at reviewing and 
hopefully improving on 1 or 2 things. This is an amazing 
program already, so there is probably not much to improve on.

I may attempt to convert it into other programming languages 
and see if we have any improvement in speed. We'll see.

I want to personally thank the original developers and prior 
contributers!!!
